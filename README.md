# Cinemaflix

A movie search web app called Cinemaflix.  Check it out [here!](https://cinemaflix.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

The idea was to build a nice looking web application to search for movies, show the results and display as much information as possible (such as the year of release, poster images, etc.) provided by the OMDb API. The website is fully responsive and features a minimalistic design I handcrafted myself.

## Built with

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- Request - Node package to make http calls
- OMDb API (JSON) - The Open Movie Database API provides data from IMDB and RottenTomatoes
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## API limitations

- Maximum search results limit of 10
- Blank search not allowed

## Future updates

- [ ] Make a separate show page with much more information about selected movie
